# roblox-universal-gun-framework
This readme contains instructions for use and how to manipulate the framework to your game's style.<br/>
I'll post the instructions when the library is finished.<br/>
I'll also make the setup less difficult since right now it takes a while

## NOTICE

I am currently re-writing this framework. The fist prototype came to a huge unsolvable problem so now I am taking a different approach in creating this framework. Now that I have learned more about creating such a framework I am also able to make it a lot better.
